# CS4171-Programming-for-AI-Assignment-II-2023
The assignment is to generate plots of two sets of data that originated from [eirgrid.ie](https://www.eirgrid.ie/).

## Grade: A1

 - must be submitted through Linux in CSIS
 - must be written in **Julia**
 - file names must be correct    

### Objective:   
We saw previously how eirgrid, maintains data at 15-minute intervals on thenation’s  electricity  supply.   The  assignment  is  to  generate  plots  of  two  sets  of  data  thatoriginated  with  eirgrid  but  that  will  be  available  to  you  in~cs4171/proj/proj02.   Thetwo  fileswind-gen.csvandsystem-demand.csvtrack,  respectively,  the  wind  generationcontribution  to  total  electricity  generation  –  both  what  was  actually  generated  and  whatwas forecasted, and the system-wide electricity demand.  All figures are in megawatts, MW.
